        `The most surprising album from last time's list is "Metah" by Dvar! I expected it to be rock but it was surprisingly chill and I think I'll check out more albums by them.`,
        `"; [Semicolon]" was also surprising; I've had a bias against K-Pop since I hear it all the time from other people, although to be honest I had the same bias against trap due to me hearing the hi-hats bleeding through other people's headphones and I thought that was annoying until I listened to it myself. I thought that ";" was a REALLY solid EP. I wanna know what the sample to "Light a Flame" is.`,
        `It's funny how I came across rap; I kept seeing <span title="Kanye West">Ye</span> in memes and decided to actually see what he had made; I started with Yeezus and the first thing I heard stuck out to me cause I was deep into noise at the time. It still surprises me cause to me it's like "wow, music can sound like this? damn." I was there for the full Donda rollout and god damn was it a trip.`,
        `When I add a page, I edit a pseudo-JSON file to add the info. I forgot the commas after I wrote out the line with "遠くの愛好家". Just thought that was cool.`,
        `Anyway, my favorite album from last time's list is Neon Tracer by Dead Disk Drive. The entire thing is just amazingly immersive! I love the cover, too. There's a vibe to a city brightened up with neon lights. I wish I lived in a place like that; It's also why I added "上海／香港" to the list since it's got a cover with a similar vibe. It's beautiful, honestly.`,
        `I changed Pokemon Purple's archive around so that it's easier to read. I also made the volumes list an actual list.`,
        `Anyway, if you can, check the F12 console! I'll write some stuff there, too.`
